# Open Hypergraphs in open-source
A survey of open-source String Diagrams and Hypergraphs.

## Abstract
This project focused on Chyp, DisCoPy and Open Hypergraphs. These libraries are the open-source implementations of several papers[cite] in the topic of String Diagrams. We see that authors have high involvement in these projects. 

## Description

### Libraries

DisCoPy and Chyp are interested in hypergraphs as string diagrams and graph rewriting. Both projects implement open (cospans of) hypergraphs from scratch.

Open Hypergraphs implements a data structure focused on performance and parallelism. There are implementations both for hypergraphs and open hypergraphs.

We evaluated these libraries based on:
* features
* implementation differences
* community
* user interface

#### DisCoPy

DisCoPy is a module for string diagrams. The UI is based on Matplotlib. One builds diagrams by writing Python code. It is a non-profit incorporated in 2022.

#### Chyp

Chyp is an interactive theorem prover UI. It works very well, is fast and allows reading and writing `.chyp` files. The project is written mostly from scratch without dependencies. One can write such files outside of Chyp but there is no support.

#### Open Hypergraphs

Open Hypergraphs implements a data structure focused on performance and parallelism. It is not only a generic implementation of hypergraphs and open hypergraphs but also fast.
