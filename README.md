## Submissions
### [YAML Diagrams](./YAML%20Diagrams)
https://github.com/yaml-programming/diagrams

This project gives an interoperable string diagram specification based on the YAML language. Using monoidal semantics it enriches this popular data language with programming capabilities. We publish the yaml-diagrams package that uses PyYAML and DisCoPy to generate, draw and compute string diagrams.
