## Programming tool submission

> This consists of a 3-page description of a programming tool or framework, with a strong preference for open-source contributions.

I will use DisCoPy to develop a UNIX shell program that reads and outputs streams of YAML docs.

I will enrich the docs' underlying digraphs to use string diagrams and graph rewriting.

My vision is a production-ready programming environment and runtime for DisCoCat. E.g this tool can provide a formal alternative to kustomize or helm.

I'm excited to bring category theory to the masses using YAML as a bridge.
