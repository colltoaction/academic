# [QPL 2024](https://qpl2024.dc.uba.ar/)

## Introduction

The 21st International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2024) will take place from July 15th to 19th, 2024, at University of Buenos Aires.

I was born in Buenos Aires and also studied at UBA. I'm a Bachelor in Computer Science and I'm excited to be part of this conference.

This repository contains my Programming tool submission as requested in the call for papers:
* https://qpl2024.dc.uba.ar/cfp.html

## Important dates

* Abstract submission: February 26, 2024
* Paper submission deadline: March 4, 2024

## Programming tool submission

> This consists of a 3-page description of a programming tool or framework, with a strong preference for open-source contributions.

I will use DisCoPy to develop a UNIX shell program that reads and outputs streams of YAML docs.

I will enrich the docs' underlying digraphs to use string diagrams and graph rewriting.

My vision is a production-ready programming environment and runtime for DisCoCat. E.g this tool can provide a formal alternative to kustomize or helm.

I'm excited to bring category theory to the masses using YAML as a bridge.
