# Abstract
At the heart of Monoidal Computation lives Higher-order Logic, encoded as a Signature. A signature S is composed of a set of types, dom and cod functions. We show an adjunction between Directed Graphs and Signatures using the in/out-neighborhood.

As we shall see the signature is symmetric, since the predecessors and successors contain the same information.

We contribute to the Term Graph field with such proof and open-source software.

This adjunction is simpler than previous categorizations such as gs-monoidal signatures.

Signatures, specially multi-sorted, provide a framework to work with free categories. We define a novel mapping between a digraph and a multi-sorted signature using predecessors (successors) as the input (output) sorts.
